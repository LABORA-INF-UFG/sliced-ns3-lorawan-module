# Sliced-LoRaWAN Module
This module adaptation was developed to support the paper [Dynamic resources allocation in non-3GPP IoT networks involving UAVs
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10199941) experimentations.

A detailed version of how to replicate the paper experimentations can be found in [LABORA-Non3GPP IoT imulations](https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/non3GPP_IoT_simulations)
